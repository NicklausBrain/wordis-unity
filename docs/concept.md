# Concept

<b>Wordis</b> is an experimental spin-off from the classical Tetris game but using characters and words as building blocks.

It appears that a [similar game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordtris) had been implemented and eventually forgotten long ago. It is still possible to play it through [the DOS emulator](https://classicreload.com/wordtris.html).
