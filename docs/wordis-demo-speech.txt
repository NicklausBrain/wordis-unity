Hello, I am Nick, from the Sigma team.
And let me introduce our work which is the Wordis puzzle.
Wordis is essentially a Tetris spin-off, where the goal is to match the words by the letters falling down the playing area.
Up to this moment we've managed to implement a minimum valuable functionality to start the publishing procedure.
If it passes it would be our very first game released.

I believe this concept itself is very scalable and can be really successful if done right:
For instance it can be extended with
	- the different shapes falling down
	- additional game objects: erasing or mixing the existing letters
	- word learning capabilities
	- support of the different languages
	- etc
	
So our plan for now is to manage extending it with a level-based gameplay, to make a user feel the advancement.
I hope we'll get it in time.
