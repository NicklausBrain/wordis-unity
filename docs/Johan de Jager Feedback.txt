Here you go:
- Overall a strong concept, but should be made more digestable
- Change the controls to be swiping instead of tapping, this game for reference: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.n3twork.tetris&hl=en&gl=US
- Add clear objectives to complete the level (certain words that you need to make)
- Make the game level-based (instead of endless)
- Add some small animations/effects
- Change the color of the game to be more bright
- Smaller grid, to again make the game more digestable
